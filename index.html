<p>"That we were wonderful traveling companions but in the end no more than <br> lonely lumps of metal in their
  own separate orbits.From far off they look like beautiful <br>shooting stars, but in reality
   they're nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked <br>up alone, going nowhere.

    Maybe even open our hearts to each other.But that was only <br>for the briefest moment.
  In the next instant we'd be in absolute solitude. Until we burned up <br>and became nothing."</p>
